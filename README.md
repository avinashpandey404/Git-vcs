Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds,

'''git init'''
the same genius who created the Linux operating system in 1991.
He built Git because he needed a fast, reliable, and distributed version control system for managing the Linux kernel’s huge codebase.

So every time you use Git, you’re standing on the shoulders of one of the greatest software creators in history.I hope this blog has enhanced your comprehension of the git and github concept.
